FAQ

Q1. render vs redirect_to?
Ans: If you're using render, when the user refreshes the page, it will submit the previous POST request again. This may cause undesired results like duplicate purchase and others.
But if you're using redirect_to, when the user refreshes the page, it will just request that same page again. 
So the place where redirect_to should be used is when you're doing a HTTP POST request and you don't want the user to resubmit the request when it's done (which may cause duplicate items and other problems).

------Migration------

Q1. Creating Migration?
Ans: Migration files are automatically generated when we generate a new model. And the column_name:datatype provide while creating model (i.e. title:string, body:text) are included as columns in migration file (i.e. t.string :title, t.text :body).

Q2. Manipulating Database?
Ans: Command "$ rails db:migrate" is used to manipulate the database. It can be seen in db/schema.rb after running db:migrate.

Q3. Adding new column to already generated Table/Model and creating new Migration?
Ans: For perfoming such changes we will create new Migrations for the particular Table/Model. Like, 
"$ rails generate migration AddStatusToArticles status:string"
"$ rails generate migration AddStatusToComments status:string"
The class name (i.e. AddStatusToComments) should be relevant to the task. 
Now to add new column we use predefined method "add_column" inside def change.
(create_table, change_column, add_index, remove_column are some other Migration methods.)
